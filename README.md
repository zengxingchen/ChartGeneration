## ChartGeneration
This repository introduces a chart generation engine designed to create a dataset that includes a diverse range of real-world chart types and QA tasks, addressing the distribution bias found in existing datasets.
The below figure outlines our chart generation pipeline, which encompasses two phases: ***(1) Retrieval-Augmented Chart Generation*** and ***(2) Visualization-Referenced Encoding Augmentation***.
